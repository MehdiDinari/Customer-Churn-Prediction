# 🍵 Expresso Customer Churn Prediction

## 🚀 My Approach
- **Handled missing values** effectively
- **Preprocessed categorical variables** for better model performance
- **Implemented clustering** to enhance feature engineering
- **Created new features** to improve predictive power
- **Used K-Fold validation** for robust performance evaluation
- **Applied model blending** for better generalization

## 🔧 Potential Improvements
- **Feature selection** to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency
- **Better handling of missing data** for improved robustness
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for further performance optimization

## 📦 Requirements
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
